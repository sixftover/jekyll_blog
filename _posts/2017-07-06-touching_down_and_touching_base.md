Between apartment hunting, starting jobs, and time zone adjustments, Ollie and I have been exhausted. We had this whole plan that included having our blog completed and ready to go weeks ago, but we are facing the fact that if we don’t take time to take care of ourselves, we don’t function in life...so the blog got pushed to the back burner. 

However, we learned some valuable lessons in research (by trial and error, mostly) that helped to facilitate our ability to smoothly transition into living in Shanghai full-time. Then again, our transition into the city full-time was a bit of a nightmare, but we learned the dos-and-don’ts relatively quickly as we went along. 

####Do Your Apartment Hunting Ahead of Time

Now, this is tricky, because real estate move so quickly in Shanghai. That means that half of the apartments that we found before arriving and loved were gone by the time we got there. However, this is a crucial step because it gives you an idea of what is out there, the prices, and the locations that have the most available. 

My method was to find two apartments that I liked every day and to keep track of size, price, location, and amenities. This helped me to understand what things were reasonable to request from the landlord before signing a contract or what would raise vs. lower the rent. This also helped me to emotionally be okay when apartments would be rented because I became really aware of how much was out there. (Something key to know so that you don’t get charmed by the “uniqueness” of pricey apartments and agree to prices that are unreasonable). 

####Diversify Your Real Estate Pool

So, before we even touched down in Shanghai, I already had standing appointments with three different real estate agents from three different companies. One was from LianJia, one from JRE, and one from Tang House. I choose these three because it had a pretty large spread in regard to quality, price, location, etc. This is important to us because we didn’t want to feel like we were jaded by the pretty apartments that were really unnecessary for our moderately short term stay in the city. 

We figured that we would see a variety of different quality of apartments in the same day. This help actually conceptualize how much better certain apartment are than others. If we were standing in an apartment that was 11,000 RMB but the only difference between that one and the 8,000 RMB a month apartment was that it had an oven, there was a problem. This was not a reasonable price change considering a table-top oven costs about $50-100 as a one-time payment. These were discrepancies that we looked for when we were bopping around and seeing all of these different apartments. 

####Give Yourself a Break for Time to Process

I don’t mean like “give yourself a break, cut yourself some slack.” I mean give yourself an actual break. Ollie and I barely had time to settle between apartments, but the little time that we did have meant that we could actually discuss the things that we did and did not like about each apartment without being incredible overwhelmed by the fact that we were standing in the apartment. 

Along the way, we kept a note about the things that we didn’t like and loved about each apartment so that this list of concerns could keep us remembering things when we had hindsight bias. I would really recommend taking your own pictures of each apartment, but that’s not particular to Shanghai… in general it’s good to do. 


####Make a List of “Other” Things That Need to Get Done

I can even start the list for you: internet, setting up a phone plan, opening a bank account (careful with this one as policies have changed as of July 1, 2017), ordering water (if that’s what you want to do), getting WeChat pay or Alipay set up, setting up MoBike. These things can get set up before or after finding an apartment depending on what they are, and somehow getting it all into a list seems more manageable. 

After you get the list set up, do some research on costs and what you’ll need to do (for example, China Telecom tells you right on their English website that they have a promotional annual plan for 200mb/s at a rate of 1,900). Look into what phone service plans work best for you (Do you need an international plan? Will you only use data in Shanghai? Will you be traveling around China frequently? Does data matter to you more than minutes?) Things like this will really help facilitate the process. I know that it may seem like some of this is in the “no brainer” category, but even I forget to prepare in some ways and I consider myself to be a highly organized person.


I do want to commend and give a shout out to the best real estate agent ever: Kris. She is an absolutely fabulous human and agent from Joanna Real Estate (JRE). She was flexible, worked late hours to help us, and made herself available to ease our minds and answer questions. She argued to lower rent on our behalf for several apartments, and if you have to pay a finder’s fee, you may as well pay it to someone who really deserves it. Kris is one of those agents. She’s excellent at her job, and made what was an incredibly stressful process as easy as possible. Her WeChat is lily_0715.
