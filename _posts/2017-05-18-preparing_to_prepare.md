#Preparing to Prepare

###18 May 2017

You can never really be ready for a major move or shift in life. At some point you just have to take a leap of faith that it will all work out and that your things won’t magically fall out of a plane, and that the apartment you find will be great, and you just let go of all of the stress that has been bogging you down for days and weeks and months. Now is not that time.

We are still in the preparing to prepare stage. The stage where everything seems like the most stressful process in the world, half of our lives sit in the unknown, and there still enough time to cling to desperation before we have no choice but to relax. We desperately want to be at that next stage. We will be soon.

For now, the biggest step is to just arrange our lives and needs and wants in a way that will best facilitate a transition from point A to point B. This comes a little easier for me, as I am in Shanghai and have lived in Shanghai on and off for about 3 and a half years, but I will admit that transitioning from student to professional in this city is much more of a leap than I thought it would be. Never mind the fact that I have only ever lived in Shanghai for 4 or 5 months at a time with large gaps of time in between. Full time expat life will be something that I am not accustomed to, but hopefully will not leave me with dread or stress for the future.

First and foremost, we have started to consider the things that are most crucial to our happiness given the amount of time that we plan to live in Shanghai, and the conveniences that we are accustomed to. Some things that we are used to in our everyday life in the U.K. and the U.S.A. are easy to let go of, but others...not so much. 

I never thought I would be so desperately attached to a dryer until I lived in an apartment without one. A luxury like this is extremely uncommon in China, as most buildings in Shanghai have clothing blowing in the breeze to dry. In fact, you can almost always say that if an apartment has a dryer, it is targeted toward foreigners, as this appeal doesn’t actually entice many Chinese people. Dryers aren’t simply a luxury that costs too much, it is actually preferred to dry clothing in fresh air. 

Secondly, I have found that I really can’t live in an apartment without an oven. China has tripled my creativity in the kitchen, but it has not killed my love for the convenience and loveliness of an oven. This has a simple solution, however. In China, many apartments may not have an oven, but for a small price (relatively small compared to the length of use) you can purchase a counter top toaster oven, which essentially has the same result as any other oven, the only inconvenience being that it takes up a lot of valuable space. But again, this is something that is compromisable. 

Beyond what is inside of the apartment, something we have discussed extensively is location. As is the case in any city, location can be extremely essential to both lifestyle and overall happiness. With rentable bikes throughout the city, it is not entirely difficult to get around, but I am a huge advocate for living within walking distance of my most frequented places. This makes our best interest either near Jing’An station or West Nanjing Station. Both hot places to live, and often more expensive for a smaller space. But, the amount of time and money that is saved from not having to cab or bike everywhere is actually quite a bit. Then again, being able to find an apartment in the perfect location, at the perfect price, with the perfect amenities can be difficult. Thus, the stress. 

So, how do we prepare to prepare? The following are some websites and tools that we have used to keep ourselves organized, facilitate research, and get us in a place where that leap of faith doesn’t feel like a 40 story drop. 

####Google Sheets

Overall, Ollie and I have come up with a relatively good way of handling demands, requests, and concerns. We have several spreadsheets that allow for us to signal what things we want in the apartment or we want in general for our lives (gym memberships, WeWork/nakedHub memberships etc.) to be comfortable, and not have too much additional stress adding to culture shock or lifestyle shock. Most importantly in this move is just generally keeping track of all of the conversations that we have had. Almost every conversation we have leads back to talking about China, our future, and our hopes. You can imagine how long the list gets to wishful thinking. 


####SmartShanghai

This website has always been my go-to foreigner’s Shanghai guide. Even if we don’t end up directly renting one of the apartments, SmartShanghai can help facilitate initial connections with Real Estate Agents who can be on the lookout for your perfect home. With how quickly the housing market moves in Shanghai, being able to have a reliable place to look at housing is essential. It can be daunting and intimidating, but this website can really help get an idea of appropriate pricing, range of renovation, and general availability. 

Additionally, SmartShanghai has resources for job listings, buy and sell pages, and general information on venues that can help with settling into the city. My first encounters with SmartShanghai had solely to do with their taxi card feature. If SmartShanghai has the listing on file, then the Chinese address taxi card is readily prepared at the touch of a finger. In 2013, when I spoke no Mandarin, this was key to my survival. 

Now, I have a much more complex relationship with this App and website. They have great information on new and upcoming places to see and visit, they have the resources I already explained, and the ease of use just gives me more confidence in exploring this city.
