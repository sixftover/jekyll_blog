#Hong Kong: Dim Sum, Dim Sum More

>“I have to leave the country every 60 days, Ollie. I have no choice in the matter. They force me to go,” I said. 

**He looked at me with knowing eyes.**

>“Oh, yes. What a problem that is for you. Now you won’t have the opportunity to make up an excuse as to why you have to leave…”

**Fair point.** 

It’s not that I am the only one with passion for travel, it’s just that Ollie has a calm head on his shoulders, whereas I will come screaming through the apartment door with tickets to a new destination that I just had to book before we lost the deal. 

However, when we decided to go to Hong Kong for my first visa trip, it was definitely a mutual choice. Despite years of living in Shanghai, I had never made the trip to Hong Kong as I just never felt a pull to do so. Nevermind the fact that the only vacations that I got from university where I didn’t go home were ones that they entire country got, so the amount of movement in and out of the country made it completely unappealing to travel at that time. But when the conversation came up about where our first Asian destination would be for a short trip, we both wanted to go to Hong Kong. 

Now, even though it’s been on my list for a while, it was surprisingly not a trip that I had explicitly planned for. Anyone who has ever traveled with me or near me knows that I plan extensively before taking off. Now, that doesn’t mean that I plan every moment, but it means that when I arrive, I don’t have to guess what I want to do. I have a list that Ollie and I can look at and decide in the moment what we want to do. Sometimes we just wander. But I always like to come prepared with information so that we never feel like we are wasting valuable time just looking things up. So, obviously, I knew that I had to get it together and get my list going. 
The two most important elements of said list are the food section and the activities section. With absolute emphasis on the former. Ollie and I are avid food travelers. This is something that still entertains me as we are not particularly adventurous eaters. We are both usually willing to try things, but there are some things that we generally just don’t eat, such as seafood. That being the case, you would think that we wouldn’t be traveling to harbor/water adjacent places for the food. Yet, we do. Because the only thing that is more important to me than travel is the food that comes with it. Consequently, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out some good eats and some fun activities.

So if food is my passion when traveling, Ollie’s passion is photography. I want to say that it is mine as well, and although I love photography, I am nowhere near Ollie’s level. Knowing this, however, means that whenever I look for activities, I always try to find good vantage points for his photography. Anyone who has already been to Hong Kong will know that there really aren’t any problems finding good views. However, the research needed time, all the same. 

I still felt mildly underprepared for this trip before leaving, and it didn’t really help that we didn’t really finish packing until 20 minutes before leaving. As we walked toward the metro to go to the airport, I did my checklist run through with Ollie where I listed off all of the essentials, and although he had left 2-3 things behind, we just trusted we would be able to find it on the other end. But going into a trip knowing already that you have forgotten something is arguable worse than going in with a feeling that you forgot something, but not knowing what it is. 






I never had a relationship with 7/11 before moving to Shanghai. But now, when I see a 7/11 I nearly get giddy. As Ollie has come to understand, it’s because 7/11s in Korea gave me Twix, 7/11s in Shanghai gave me Doritos, and now 7/11s in Hong Kong have given me midnight snacks.
