# Navigating Hong Kong Airport: Arrival and Departure

## Arrival

### Arriving at Hong Kong Airport

Late night flights are always so much better in theory. On the one hand, we get the full benefit of the day time (whether it’s for me to work an extra shift before taking off, or to save use the expense of one more night at a hotel at our destination on the other end). On the other hand, I still have never met a person that legitimately enjoys flights where they take off and land in the middle of the night. The only exception to this rule is probably long haul flights because natural exhaustion means there's a sliver of hope of sleep for those of us that find seated sleeping to be an impossible task.

So, that being said, a late night flight to Hong Kong/香港 meant that we were already going to be exhausted upon landing. With anyone else, I probably would have avoided such a stressful situation, but between my over-preparedness for travel and Ollie’s calm ability to handle most crises while on trips, I figured we would eventually make it from point A to point B.

### Immediate Arrival

Turns out that the “escape from the airport” scenario that seems to be a major episode in every travel experience was not actually that complicated in Hong Kong Airport. The airport is gorgeous, and extremely accustomed to the thousands of foreigners/老外 that flow through on the daily. After you arrival, you’ll likely need to take a tram to arrivals. It doesn’t take long, and all of the signs are in English, but don’t be surprised if your personal space is invaded a bit.

On the immediate arrival side of the experience, there’s customs and baggage claim like any other airport. On the plane or when you arrive in the customs area, you can find an arrival form. There are two sheets for this arrival card and you’re supposed to press down pretty hard so that almost all of the information carbon copies underneath. This is because the sheet underneath is your departure form and it is linked to the form on top by number. Don't lose it. Additionally, when you go through customs, they give you a printed slip rather than stamping your passport (major disappointment and also the cause of a lot of stress). You need to keep this slip until you leave, so you have to make sure that you agree with yourself that you’ll be responsible and not lose it for the duration of your trip. I actually don’t know what happens if you lose either of these things as we managed to hang onto them the whole time. However, I am fairly certain that many people do lose these items over the course of their trip, and I found that a large majority of people spoke English in addition to Cantonese (and Mandarin, usually), so don’t panic if this happens to you. Just find someone who looks like they work at the airport and ask them what the procedure is.

Aside from needing to find a spot where you won’t lose what they should just stick into your passport, there aren’t really any other major difference between arriving at Hong Kong Airport and arriving at any other airport.


### Post-Customs: Wifi, Getting to the City, and Snacks

Despite popular belief, most airports in Asia have English in addition to the local language all over the airport, and this was certainly the case at Hong Kong Airport. Therefore, all of the different options for leaving the airport are laid out for the picking.

Getting from Hong Kong Airport to the actually city is fairly simple. There are two pretty simple options that come directly to mind: you can either take a Taxi/Uber if you’re rolling in money/钱, or if you’re a little too 便宜/cheap like the two of us, you can take the Airport Express. This dumps out at the Central metro station in the IFC mall and from there you can take the metro pretty much anywhere. Otherwise, you can do what we did and take either Uber or a taxi that is waiting outside of the station.

It’s actually a great set up to buy Airport Express tickets, because while Ollie bought our tickets for about £8/$11, I was able to lock down some nacho cheese Doritos and Twix bars (I was only supposed to get water, but after 60 days with minimal access, let me tell you, there are few things more important than snacks and chocolate). Luckily enough, the 7/11 and a few other options for grabbing snacks and little necessities are available on both sides of arrivals. Actually, there are plenty of options for snacks and full meals at pretty much any time you could go to the airport.

Oh, and there is one thing more important than snacks. It is WiFi. I had done some research before arrival, but it turned out to not actually be that necessary considering it’s such a well organized airport. Upon entering the “arrivals” section of Hong Kong Airport, we were faced with several kiosks that were open quite late, considering it was nearly midnight. There were 2-3 of pure pocket WiFi options and a couple of SIM/data plan situations. We went for the Banana brand of Pocket WiFi as it suited our needs for about £6/$8 a day. Warning/side note: we had to pay for an extra day as we weren’t willing to wait until midnight (20 min) for it to turn to the “next day.” Most places, it would seem, charge from 12am-12am. This can be great for if you have a late flight on the back end, because you don’t have to worry about getting to the airport really early so that you can return the little pocket WiFi.

Our actual rental came with a case, charging chords, and a power bank so that it would last for most of the day. We ended up actually having to use our own power banks, as we spent most of the day walking around, which meant that we ate through the batteries far before we returned to the hotel. Honestly, if you don’t have a portable charger by now, I am not sure how you have survived as a traveler. In the case of portable WiFi, it’s a must.

One of the options that I briefly mentioned was a SIM card. This is a great option for if you are staying longer than a few days. When you see the options at Hong Kong Airport, the prices will likely be a lot higher than if you went somewhere else. However, the convenience of it sometimes makes it worth it. I can’t really say which is better without knowing the length of the trip. Generally, though, I would suggest a SIM card for a trip longer than a week and portable WiFi for shorter.

## Departure

### Getting From the City to Hong Kong Airport

Once again, we decided to use the Airport Express as it was so effective and only cost £8/$11 per person. We left from Central Station again, and it was a great surprise that at this station they actually have baggage check in. If you have an Express ticket, you can check in for free before getting on the train, and hand over any luggage you have. We didn’t have checked baggage, but the perk was that we headed to Hong Kong Airport a little earlier than expected, so we were afraid we would have to wait before security and customs until the check-in desk opened for our Hong Kong Airlines flight. However, thanks to the Airport Express, we were able to check in at Central and get our boarding passes printed so that when we arrived we could just go straight through customs to the departure gates.

### Departure Security and Customs at Hong Kong Airport

So, after hopping on the Airport Express, we had a quick journey to Hong Kong Airport, and were able to swiftly pass in our WiFi, and scoot through to security and customs.

The customs process is just as painless on the way out as it was on the way in. Since we had managed not to lose our visa slips or our departure forms, all we had to do was fill in our new flight number and then sign. The line was very quick, and after handing them all of the necessary documents, we were done with that step. Similar to how it is in Shanghai, customs doesn’t really ever try to talk to you or ask questions. On the rare occasion that they do, there’s still a high chance of finding someone who is an English speaker, so please do not panic about customs in Asia. It’s rarely an issue if you are polite and don’t lose things.

Unlike a lot of airports, Hong Kong Airport is actually really well organized which means that security did not take us longer than 10-15 minutes total. We were even there at a fairly busy time and didn’t have any trouble at all. So, it was onward to the gates for us.

### Departure Gates: Shops and Food

I have to start with a small disclosure so that it doesn’t seem like we just sit around in airports all day. Ollie and I both had to work during this trip, and during an entire day of our Hong Kong adventure, we were confined to our hotel with barely any WiFi due to a typhoon (#classic Hong Kong). As a result, we needed to be working for our last day and with our flight at night, we figured that the airport would be an ok place to bunker down and work for a bit so that we wouldn’t have to worry about traffic. So, it is for this reason that we got to know our little departure section of Hong Kong Airport so well.

When you get past customs, there’s a tram again to take you to certain terminals. To get to ours, we had to get on the little metro-like shuttle, but it’s free (obviously) and doesn’t take long at all. You just may have your personal space invaded a bit, again.

Firstly, the entire top floor of the Hong Kong Airport departures area is food. There is a big food court with plenty of options (including Popeyes and McDonalds for my foreign food cravings) for both meals and dessert. As is the case with most airports, the food is actually pretty expensive (although not so outrageous that we would rather have starved).

For those of you who have traveled to Asia, this will come as no surprise, but there was a lot of table hoarding at the airport. The reason I highlight Asia as a common culprit of this tendency is because although I have seen similar space hoarding in other places, I have never seen it to the scale that I see it in Asia, especially Mainland China. Consequently, it can be hard to find an open table in the food court section, and it was a little too dirty and loud for our liking.

Around the corner from the food court, however, were two big restaurants, and a little café that was attached to one of them. We decided to buckle down at the café, and only after realizing that coffee was about £6/$8 a cup did we panic. Figuring we would do that really annoying customer thing where you order something and then stay forever, we let the price roll. But, honestly, unless we wanted to stay there, it was not a good choice.

Next to this café restaurant combo, there was a giant Pizza Express. Of course, we wanted to know how close it was to the real thing. (We are allowed this one discrepancy because we had been in total Asia mode for 2 months and sometimes you just want a little taste of home). Between our pizza order not actually being put in and the general taste being underwhelming, we were not too pleased with this life experience, but oh well.

For anyone returning to Mainland China or going somewhere where medication is difficult to find, there was a giant pharmacy near the gates where you can purchase pretty much anything you’d find in a CVS in the USA (shampoo, deodorant, medication, toothpaste etc.). Really convenient for if you forget something.

There are a TON of designer shops in Hong Kong Airport, if that’s what you’re into. We weren’t, but there are definitely plenty of options for the last minute shopper, or the duty free lover.

What we did love, though was that there was a Relay bookshop near the gates when we finally got to ours, so we could get some books for the flight and some snacks for the flight home to Shanghai. It’s great that there’s something right before you leave.

# Overall

All in all, Hong Kong Airport is big, clean, and organized. There was little confusion and absolutely no reason for us to need to ask personnel any questions, so I consider that to be a great thing.

Major downside is that if you aren’t near the gates, it is really hard to find an outlet, which isn’t the end of the world, but if you’re trying to do any sort of work, can be a hassle.

If you are going to spend time at Hong Kong Airport, be prepared to spend money to sit anywhere but your gate. However, know that there are plenty of options for dining and the food court allows for families or groups with a variety of tastes to all be happy with their options.

Six Feet Over is definitely not opposed to returning to Hong Kong soon knowing that the airport is so simple to navigate.
