Before leaving for Shanghai, Ollie and I have been scattered and trying to gather thoughts and items before setting off. As any frequent flier knows, luggage space and weight becomes incredibly valuable when traveling a long distance for a long period of time. When traveling in the past, I have always reserved at least one suitcase for both food and toiletries that are unavailable to me on the other side of the world. 

Now, don’t get me wrong. Shanghai being the city that it is means that there are plenty of imported goods, but things can either have an incredibly high price, or the particular thing you’re looking for is unavailable. So, if there’s anything that can’t be lived without, it’s vital that it comes straight from the source. Over the years, I have found that this list has become my crutch. 

####Hair Care and Toiletries

Between bleaching creams and damaging shampoos for fine hair, I learned the hard way to bring my own hygiene items. Shampoo, conditioner and face wash are the three most important items for me, but for many travelers the list doesn’t end here. Make sure that if you have sensitive skin that you include items such as sunscreen (this is something that is easy to forget if you are used to seasonally traveling outside of the summer months). 

####Spices

This section, for me at least, is so important that I don’t even group it under the food category. Spices are everything, especially when traveling to a country where the flavor pallette is not necessarily the same as yours. I bring spice mixes that I know I cannot find in Shanghai, because when I am missing something as simple as a well-seasoned burger, I don’t want to have to pay 90RMB (about $13.50 USD) on a burger in a city where Western food doesn’t have to be good to be expensive. When I miss foreign foods, I can make them in the comfort of my own home if I have access to the flavors that I know and love. 

####Food

Obviously, there are other foods that take priority for travel as well. Oddly enough, I always find myself to crave the most bizarre things while abroad. In my first year as a student in Shanghai, I found myself craving PopTarts (something I hadn’t eaten in like 10 years and never particularly liked before then). Nowadays, I always make sure to have a couple of bags of sweet and salty popcorn, some sort of chocolate, and a box of Lucky Charms for emergencies. Additionally, I like to bring water flavoring packets (like lemonade mix) as I don’t like sugary drinks, but tire of just drinking water. 

####Kitchenware Items

Over in China, ovens are not very common in a given household. They’ve started to gain popularity, but even still, most Chinese apartments don’t have ovens. Consequently, many items related to baking are really expensive. So, before moving over to Shanghai for full-time residence, Ollie and I went to the Pound Land and Dollar Tree in the U.K. and USA, respectively, and picked up some items that we could easily carry over, ourselves. It’s not necessarily that things like muffin tins and cookie sheets cannot be found in Shanghai, but they are incredibly cheap in the USA and the U.K. and most of the time don’t take up much weight or space. In addition to bakeware, I bring with me a meat thermometer, some measuring things, and an assortment of cooking utensils. IKEA has many of these items, but it does add up even over there. I will admit that there are many items that can be found for cheap and reasonable prices on TaoBao, but you have to be cautious with quality and reliability, and when you’re moving for the first time, it’s nice to have some things guaranteed. 

####Household Items

This is a personal preference. When Ollie and I were shopping around for bits that would make our lives a little easier, we spied a couple of items that would merely make it more fun. A blanket from home, a decoration from familiar walls...these are things that keep you close to the places that you leave behind. 

####Special Clothing Items

When packing clothing, don’t forget to pack at least one comfort outfit. I find that I always prioritize packing the things that I will wear out of the house--to class, to work, to dinner, to bars. I always used to gleam over the cozy outfits that I love curling up in on a rainy night when mac and cheese and a movie is in order. And every time I remember to pack it, I never regret it. 


All in all, luggage space is a hot commodity for travelers. Whether for a short trip or a long move, you can never be too certain you haven’t forgotten something. Ollie and I are fully confident that we are forgetting some things, ourselves, but have discovered that as long as we have the essentials, the rest is just gravy.
